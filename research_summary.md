## Research Statement

  Fish are a the last wild caught protein source on the planet. Fisheries both marine and freshwater support INSERT NUMBER & CITATION of people around the earth both nutritionally and economically. Unfortunately, aquatic ecosystems, both freshwater and marine have never been so threatened. In this era of rapid climatic and environmental change understanding how aquatic organisms respond and predicting species outcomes will be essential for global food security, economic prosperity as well as human and ecosystem health. 
  Managing our aquatic ecosystems requires understanding them across scales. My work uses physiology to understand fish at *their* level.   
  
* How does an organism respond to environmental change?
* How might changes to the landscape improve an organsisms capacity to survive?
* What are the strategies and principles for building ecosystem understanding from the bottom up?
  

## Project Summaries

### Interpopulation Variation among Chinook Salmon

Research on other salmonid species (INSERT CITATIONS) demonstrates that individual populations of salmon can exhibit unique physiological traits which reflect the environmental conditions of their natal rivers. Chinook salmon *Onchorhynchus tshawytscha* exists as a large, complex, metapopulation complex along the Western Coast of North America. This project seeks to explore how different populations of Chinook salmon from across the West Coast of the United States differ in regards to their thermal physiology and metabolism. We hypothesize that populations from further north (e.g. Washington) may exhibit reduced physiological performance at warm temperatures than southern populations in California. Although we are keeping an eye on alternative drivers of population variation (e.g. local environmental conditions, migration route, anthropogenic effects etc.) We are testing our hypotheses by measuring several traits of thermal physiological performance; temperature-dependent growth, critical thermal maximum and aerobic scope ( [still curious?](http://www.kenzillig.github.io/interpop.html#performance-metrics) ). I am also quantifying the capacity for each population to acclimate to changes in water temperature by rearing each populations across a shared temperature regime.
	This project was funded in part by the EPA and USFWS with the intention of informing management criteria and conservation goals for protecting Chinook salmon populations. If you would like to explore this project more please [click here](http://www.kenzillig.github.io/interpop.html).
