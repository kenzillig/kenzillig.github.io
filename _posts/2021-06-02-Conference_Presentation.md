Back in early April I gave a talk as a part of a special session at the Bay Delta Science Conference (held virtually). This conference is a biannual event which brings together scientists and managers from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to share research revolving around the biology, hydrology and conservation of the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta system. 

The special sessions I was invited to was entitled **Advances in understanding thermal effects on salmon and temperature management for salmon in the Central Valley** and brought together researchers from both government agencies and regional Universities. 

This is my second time attending and I was excited to expand upon the research I presented two years ago which has grown to become my full dissertation. Apparently my enthusiasm bled through and I was selected as the 2nd best talk of the conference which was an exciting first.

One perk of virtual conferences is that people from all over the world are able to attend. This is expanded even further if talks become available later...which in this case they are!

For the next few months my talk, alongside all the other conference presentations are available [here](https://baydeltascienceconference.org/). My specific session can be found [here](https://player.vimeo.com/video/546626686) and runs from minute 2:15 to 22:00. 

I hope you enjoy it and if you have any questions on the work presented or other projects plesae don't hesitate to email me.
